Use a histogram when:
You have a numeric column
    Examples:
    price
    num_children
    num_adults
    arrival_day
    checkout_day
You want to check the shape of data
    Is it normal (bell-shaped)?
    Is it skewed (many small or large values)?
    Are there outliers (extreme values far from most data)?
    Are values bimodal or multimodal (two or more peaks)?
You want to decide preprocessing steps
    If highly skewed → you might apply a log transform before modeling.
    If there are extreme outliers → you might clip or winsorize.
    If discrete small integers → histogram shows if a bar plot is better.


Don’t use histograms for:

Categorical variables like branch, country, or platform.
→ Use a bar chart instead (histogram assumes numeric bins).


value_counts = df[feature].value_counts()           - will not count row with null column value ?
You are correct. By default, value_counts() does not include rows where the column value is null (NaN).


Your Variable Types	Best Graphs to Plot
Numerical vs. Numerical	1. Scatter Plot
2. Line Plot (for time series)
3. Heatmap (for correlation)
Categorical vs. Numerical	1. Box Plot (Box-and-Whisker)
2. Violin Plot
3. Bar Plot (with means)
4. Histogram / Density Plot (facetted)
Categorical vs. Categorical	1. Stacked Bar Plot
2. Grouped Bar Plot
3. Mosaic Plot
4. Heatmap (with counts)
